# JS Dev Environment for FileMaker Developers

*Develop, Render, and Deploy JavaScript for a FileMaker App*

# This Environment
## What it does
This environment allows a FileMaker developer to start coding their widget and see the results right away in a FileMaker file. Once done developing, the can be inlined and pushed to the FileMaker file for use offline.
<br/>
It's a template file, so you can use to start other projects.
## Consists of
- A repository template on Github
- A basic html / JS set up.
- package.json file for install
- A FileMaker file to show the widget rendered
- Scripts to build and upload the inlined code to FileMaker
## TO GET STARTED Using this file
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open the FileMaker file.
4. Allow it to work in Dev mode.

At this point you should see the web viewer on the layout load up with the HTML and JavaScript here. Edit the JavaScript or the HTML and you'll see the render in the web viewer update.
